First a copy of the passed array is made. The method name does not suggest that the passed array must be changed
so in order to preserve it, a copy is created and the algorithm works with it.

A counter variable is initialized to keep track of found sets.

An endless "while" cycle is made. Algorithm in this case is more readable and understandable when the condition to stop
the cycle is inside it instead in the "while" clause.

The length of the array is saved in a variable to check if the array has been changed.

The "for" cycle starts iterating from first index to length of the array minus size of set. This way a potential
"index out of bounds" exception is avoided in the boolean expression after. The said expression checks if the element
at the current index and the next two have the same values. If so, the counter is incremented and a new array is created
without the three matching elements.

Finally, there's a boolean expression checking if the array's length is smaller than the size of searched sets
or if the array has been changed.
