First a copy of the passed array is made. The method name does not suggest that the passed array must be changed
so in order to preserve it, a copy is created and the algorithm works with it.

A counter variable is initialized to keep track of found sets.

An endless "while" cycle is made. Algorithm in this case is more readable and understandable when the condition to stop
the cycle is inside it instead in the "while" clause.

The variable, used for iteration over the array is initialized outside it. This way it is possible to know if
the "for" cycle has ended without finding a set of matching elements.

The length of the array is saved in a variable, because it is possible for the length to be changed.

The "for" cycle starts iterating from first index to length of the array minus size of set. This way a potential
"index out of bounds" exception is avoided in the boolean expression after. The said expression checks if the element
at the current index and the next two have the same values. If so, the counter is incremented and the array

Finally, there's a boolean expression checking if the array's length is smaller than the size of searched sets
or if the iteration variable has reached it's maximum value (meaning a set has not been found). If either one returns
true, then the algorithm stops and the counter is returned as result.
